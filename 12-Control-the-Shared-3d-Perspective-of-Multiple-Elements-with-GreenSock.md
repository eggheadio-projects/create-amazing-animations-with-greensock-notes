Perspective
    - [perspective docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/perspective)
    - by adjusting the perspective of the parent container you are setting the vanishing point relative to the parent container

To Demonstrate
    1. create a lot of boxes
        - use [Array.from](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from), set a length to create an array
        - use [.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) to create the div elements from the array
        - .forEach then allows you to set a class of box on each div, and append it to the document.body
        - these methods can all be chained together
        - you can now add the animation, and you can add this inside the forEach

        ```
            Array.from({length: 30})
                .map(() => document.createElement("div"))
                .forEach(box => {
                    box.setAttribute("class", "box")
                    document.body.appendChild(box)

                    box.addEventListeners("click", () => {
                        TweenMax.to(box, 1, { rotationY: "+=180" })
                    })
                })
        ```

    2. Restyle in the css 
        - on the body 
            a. remove justify-content and align-items
            b. add flex-wrap: wrap;
            c. add overflow: hidden;
        - on .box class
            - add a border so that we can see the individual boxes
        
    3. Check it out
        - as you click on different boxes you can see the perspective change based on the parent element
        - remember that a lower perspective will be more dramatic than a larger perspective

Unstick animations
    - at times animations will get 'stuck' because they weren't finished before they were activated again
    To Fix
        1. use the [.isTweening() method](https://greensock.com/docs/v2/TweenMax/static.isTweening()), which will return true if an animation is still running
        2. use a conditional to check if the animation is still running, and only run the animation if it is not
        ```
        if(!TweenMax.isTweening(box)) {
            TweenMax.to(box, 1, { rotationY: "+=180" })
        }
        ```
