# Control the Shared 3d Perspective of Multiple Elements with GreenSock

### Perspective
- ðŸ¤”[perspective docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/perspective)
- By adjusting the perspective of the parent container you are setting the vanishing point relative to the parent container.

### To Demonstrate
1. Create a lot of boxes.
    - Use ðŸ¤”[Array.from](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from), set a length to create an array.
    - Use ðŸ¤”[.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) to create the div elements from the array.
    - .forEach then allows you to set a class of box on each div, and append it to the document.body.
    - These methods can all be chained together, as shown below.
    - You can now add the animation, and you can add this inside the forEach().

    ```js
    Array.from({length: 30})
        .map(() => document.createElement("div"))
        .forEach(box => {
            box.setAttribute("class", "box")
            document.body.appendChild(box)

            box.addEventListeners("click", () => {
                TweenMax.to(box, 1, { rotationY: "+=180" })
            })
        })
    ```

2. Restyle in the css.
    - on the body 
        1. remove justify-content and align-items
        2. add `flex-wrap: wrap;`
        3. add `overflow: hidden;`
    - on .box class
        - add a border so that we can see the individual boxes
        
3. Check it out . . .
    - As you click on different boxes you can see the perspective change based on the parent element.
    - Remember that a lower perspective will be more dramatic than a larger perspective.

### Unstick animations
- At times animations will get 'stuck' because they weren't finished before they were activated again.
#### To Fix
1. Use the ðŸ¤”[.isTweening() method](https://greensock.com/docs/v2/TweenMax/static.isTweening()), which will return true if an animation is still running.
2. Use a conditional to check if the animation is still running, and only run the animation if it is not.
```js
if(!TweenMax.isTweening(box)) {
    TweenMax.to(box, 1, { rotationY: "+=180" })
}
```
