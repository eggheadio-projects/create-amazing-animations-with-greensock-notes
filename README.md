### About
This repo contains notes from John Lindquist's Egghead course [Create Amazing Animations With GreenSock](https://egghead.io/courses/create-amazing-animations-with-greensock).

These notes contain the same structure as the transcriptions, along with additional rewrites, links to resources, and personal takes on the lesson. Feel free to submit additions to these notes, but please don't remove anything (unless we messed up or misunderstood something).

Generally, there is one document for each lesson in the course. If there are related lessons, the notes will be in the same document.

### Course Description üí™
Animations attract the eye and add a higher level of engagement for your users. But they‚Äôre not easy to set up, and they don‚Äôt always look the way they should on every browser.

Greensock is the best platform available for creating performant, highly-customizable animations. This course will walk you through the features of Greensock, including how to:

- animate an element
- manually control an animation
- animate between CSS classes


. . . and more, with cross-browser support to ensure your animations look sharp everywhere.
