# Rotate an Element Based on Previous Values with Greensock

Create a box in index.html
- div with id="box"

Use gsap to style box
- use TweenMax.set() - syntax below
`TweenMax.set("selectedElement", {properties})`
- take a look at [Common CSS Properties Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference) to see how CSS properties are defined in javascript

### To rotate the box
1. use TweenMax.to() inside the eventListener callback function
```js
document.addEventListener('click', event => {
    TweenMax.to("#box", 0.5, {
        rotation: 30
    })
})
```
- expected behavior will be that a 'click' anywhere on the document will set off an animation on the div with id="box" ("#box") to change it's 'rotation' to 30 degrees
- additional clicks will appear to have no effect since the rotation is already at 30 degrees
2. to rotate on additional clicks change 
`rotation: 30`
    
    to 

`rotation: "+=30"`

- this will add 30 degrees to the current rotation value and animate the change to that new rotation value
- now additional clicks will continue to rotate the #box
