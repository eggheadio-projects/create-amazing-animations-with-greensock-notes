Create a box with basic styles in index.html
    1. div with id="box"
    2. Create css file and link it in the head of your html
    3. basic styles
        ```
        #box {
            width: 25px;
            height: 25px;
            background-color: deepskyblue
        }
        ```
Now start your server
    > yarn dev

Switch to your index.js file to add event
    1. Add event listener
        ``` 
        document.addEventListener("click", event => {}) 
        ```
    2. add TweenMax inside event listener
        ```
        document.addEventListener("click", event => {
            TweenMax.to("#box", 1, { x: 100, y: 100})
        })
        ```
TweenMax syntax is
> TweenMax.to("selectedElement", duration(in seconds), {properties})
TweenMax will move the "selectedElement" to the {properties} in the time set by duration.
So the above code will move our div with id box to x = 100px and y = 100px in 1 second.

If you want to move the box to the location of your click a few additional steps are necessary.
    1. grab the location of your click
        - this can be done by accessing the clientX and clientY properties from the click event
        ```
        document.addEventListener("click", event => {
            const {clientX, clientY} = event
        })
        ```
    2. Use the locations inside your TweenMax
        ```
        document.addEventListener("click", event => {
            const {clientX, clientY} = event

            TweenMax.to("#box", 1, { x: clientX, y: clientY})
        })
        ```
        - check it out . . . not quite right just yet is it? 
    3. eliminate body margin
        - inside your CSS file
        ```
        body {
            margin: 0;
        }
        ```
        - check it out . . . now the corner lines up with the pointer click, but to make it center on the pointer keep going.
    4. Align the center of the box to the x and y coordinates
        - use TweenMax.set, syntax looks like this
            > TweenMax.set("selectedElement", {properties})
            - this will set the {properties} of the "selectedElement" from the get go and keep them throughout animation
        ```
        TweenMax.to("#box", {xPercent: -50, yPercent: -50})
        ```
        - check it out . . . nice Right!?
